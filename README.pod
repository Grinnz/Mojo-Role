=head1 NAME

Mojo::Role - Tiny and simple role system for Mojo (DEPRECATED)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module has been renamed to L<Mojo::RoleTiny> and the namespace may be
repurposed in the future. Instead of using it, you can now create roles using
L<Mojo::Base> directly.

  # For a role class
  use Mojo::Base -role;

  # To use/consume a role
  use Role::Tiny::With;
  with 'Role::SomeRoleClass';
